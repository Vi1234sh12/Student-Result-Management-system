# Student-Result-Management-system
Proposed as a multi-user software, this Student Result Processing System is developed in Java programming language. The main aim of this project is to store the result scores of students, process the scores in user-defined way and produce their results in the form of report cards or other analysis charts. In this web-based software, both grading pattern and examination pattern are user configurable.  The complete materials/resources of Student Result Processing System Software can be accessed from the download links in this post. The download file consists of complete source code, database details, paper presentation – ppt, project report and documentation. Below, I’ve briefly described the scope, features, modules and system specifications of this result processing software application.
